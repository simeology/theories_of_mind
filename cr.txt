i am a conscious realism entity
    
    an entity that is acting on information
        as a function of an aggregation of cres
            and possibly because of (encoded in structure presumably) intrinsic behavior
                ie the thing "I" am, is not a body, but a datastructure acting (with latent goals of selfishness and reproduction) within a graph of cres of fundamental and aggregated complexity


        physics spacetime is an encoding/syntax/visualization of binary information between
            other cres
                in the instance of light, particle cres
                    or rather as presumed, belong carbon-related cres

        the illusion of spacetime, as a part of perception


        do physical actions of my data entity correspond relative to physicality
            they clearly do
                reproduction,survival is a physical act
                    as such, a lot of interaction must be with particle cres
                ie, my cre is not conjuring up a nonsensical visualization where actions on the real graph are one thing, but the visualization is something entirely different and namely correlates to a costly action (costly as in distant,resource intensive to make up for costliness on graph due to unrelated [and unvisualized] parameters) (ie for example reproduction is a singular,intrinsic on the real graph, but visualization conjures up a scene where the act is a physical one of sexual reproduction)
                    perhaps psychological distance is a nonsensical visualization
                        ie procrastination/rest, as an action on the graph is visualized, as an action with a nonsensical/unoptimal/inaccurate cost/reward/distance
                        while other internal actions
                            ie thought, are assigned other values in the self perception of cre
                    the point being however, that interaction with the physicality of cres on the graph, atleast in the case of hsap, is not an illusion
                        the question still arises
                            interaction is largely based on physicality properties and/or physicality cres (ie fundamental physicality cres, whatever they may, whether string theory or otherwise) 
                                so it appears that cr, is mainly a theory of how complex cres can arise as aggregates of physicality cres
                                    and it would appear, that in the case of reproducing cres (ie we assume that we belong to the set of objects that actually exists, namely natural cre of the universe, naturally aggregated by the universe through its execution, ie not non-concious symbols of condensed cres or artificial created entities for whom concsiousness cannot be ascertained because it is not a natural creation but rather a physicalist one)
                                        what is being survived,aggregated,greedily reproduced is the core physicality cre (and/or other fundamental cres) to begin with
                                            so it would appear that presumed fundamental physicality cres are carbon like? (atleast on earth)

        is distance as encoded in spacetime perception real?

            ie reproduction as an action, and other actions in such a data mesh are based on accuracy of distance
                distance does not appear to be an illusion


        ie, let us presume i am mathematical (namely as presented by cr theorem) conscious data entity (ie effectively a virus like data entity operating within and relative to a graph of cres)
            (its existence, arising out of reproduction, survability and fitness, with a self perception with illusion of spacetime)

            let us presume that current physics as investigated from the perspective of investigating the invalid self perception of spacetime
                can arise from conscious realism
                    ie quantum interactions are a function of conscious realism

            the self model has the following characteristics
                i am located in a certain section (or am comprised of points in a graph), relative to other conscious entities in the graph
                    i have the (latent) intent of reproduction
                        by nature of the fact of conservation/continuation of the illusion
                            of what i am, ie, the intent of reproduction is encoded in the self model
                                (as any other property of the self model, by arising out of the combinatorial dynamics of my aggregate cres)
                    my reproductive capacities
                        are comprised of aggregate cres
                            which in turn comprise of cres that delineate position

                        my encoding of viewing the cre graph, transforms/encodes the graph of entities
                            into a (visual) perception of spacetime (and other actions, including self perception arising from cre aggregation)

                        
            creation of cre (namely considering reproduction of an advanced aggregated cre)
                conception (sexual or asexual) allocates the data (dna) for the creation of
                    entities mesh,aggregate that will potentially give rise to a hsap cre (ie one who's aggregate conscious experience is comparable to hsap subjective experience and is defined by allocated conception, entities/actions) (ie combinatorial execution of aggregate cres giving rise to the apparent self model) (ie utilizes dependant cres to generate a self model) 
                        and lends to communication along it's prefered encoded channels, ie speech, vocalization, writing, etc

                        encodes machinery
                            combined with memory entities


            the point being that reality is not physical but a graph of aggregate cres

                the question arises, are advanced cres, pure combinations, or do they have intrinsic behavior



i:
    i in this sense is both body and mind*
        what mind/conciousness is, or appears to be, is executing of functions against an opentype quantum conciousness api, see the_mind.txt
            or rather encoding of function calls

            it is likely the only thing that exists
                ie finite encoding
