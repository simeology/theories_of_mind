the mind is taking input of electromagnetic data
    that is either quantum collapsing, imminently in front of it
        or has been collapsed, and is changing eigenstates
            by superdeterministic event
                ie an event at some point disturbed quantum foam to collapse
                    non-local events across light years execute super deterministically

    executing electromagnetic functions, along the negatives/sensing capabilities
        to create a rolling interpretation of this input    
            isolating its logic loop from measuring of electromagnetic data
        executing mathematical operations to present an accessible scene to the organism
            and in the case of homo sapien
                providing a faculty that resembles it's physiological implicit boolean operations (in response to universe)

    the question arises, within the context of the (potentially anthropocentric foam) what is being observed?

        is the brain, an observer, causing collapse
            or is it by a "true" observer of the quantum foam
                by reading of the quantum bits representing "conciousness"

            the question of why homo sapien presumes he is an observer
                see boolean_entities

        what seperates the presentation of the simulation of the brain to "you" the observer,
            from the data that it is presenting
                does the machinery of the brain give rise to both the "observer" and the "sensed data"
                    it likely/clearly does, because such a quantum call is likely complicated->
                            ie possibly
                                as a function of nature/the universe, ie relate to natural quantum configuration
                        however, the observer itself, irregardless of it's psuedo newtonian,biological structure in the brain
                            still boils down to an api function call instruction to spacetime that: this is valid conciousness, present the presentation

            is the presentation a quantum entangled finite set of atoms?
                ie, is the presentation, a minimally viable state machine of quantum entangled matter in space?
                    ie, every render point of matter you see, is represented by a (presumably relatively minimized) serialization in quantum state?

                        ie, in this scenario, "consciousness", you (the "rendering" as it were, of the machinery of the brain), is occuring at a quantum level, it is simply the encoding in quantum time, of what "appears" to be observed by you, ie presented to "you", the soul
                            (colors at a certain fidelity,sound,vestibular sensations)

                            what "you" truly are is a microscopic creature in space or data
                                the question arises, does the mere existence of such an encoding in quantum foam
                                    give rise to its presentation as "conciousness"
                                        or, is there a superobserver that selected its "reading"

                            in essence, "you" are not you or your body, even your brain
                                what "you" truly are a super microscopic encoding
                                    that is compromised of the relevant quantumbits in your brain

                            "you" are like an animated gif, encoded in spacetime
                                encoding for where you are

                                and necesarily in quantum spacetime, because the mind is clear interpreting electromagnetic data, namely from the eyes

                                then the question arises, to create such a concious experience, do you encode into quantum time such a serialization, and thus conciousness springs into being?

                                    is there a quantum api to serializing quantum conciousness

                                    ie, is there a quantum encoding, that provides localization geolocation of such an encoding
                                        ie, do you communicate to spacetime that can read correct serialization of quantum conciousness that this quantum conciousness exists
                                            at a such a location and it has a vestibular orientation of this nature

                                            are vestibular encodings openly typed (ie every entities vestibular encoding is like jazz, an approximated encoding that suffices)

                                            what happens if you discombulate an encoding, you only send half the data

                                            ie the api is flexible,opentype
        or perhaps, the brain need not even attempt to hide the nature of nature (that conciousness is reading of pure electromagentic entangling by a superobserver)
            and evolution/natural selection does not even bother amalgamting the "observer" structure
                as we see above, even if an observer machine,mechanism to "data" in the brain exists, it is still a call to an opentype api:
                    however, the observer itself, irregardless of it's psuedo newtonian,biological structure in the brain
                            still boils down to an api function call instruction to spacetime that: this is valid conciousness, present the presentation



in order to break the cave, you need to know the quantum conciousness api
    you need to isolate or replicate your quantum conciousness in spacetime

        augment it
or hack the system

    what this appears to mean is that quantum foam may be an api of sorts

so technically at a minimum the only
    

(namely that the observer is a machination of the brain, how it appears in biology or newtonian physics)
