human is a virtualized boolean entity in a simulation
    it is capable of boolean logic
        but is incapable of simulating to generate the illusion to itself of framerate (ie, it's observation and boolean logic runs at 10hz, it cannot execute an artificial simulation to 10hz, [and potentially fool itself into thinking that it exists in its artificial simulation])

    to a human it appears that it is an observer of the universe because 
        he can 
            design,create,initialize a simulation (ie thought)
                technically he could execute his designed simulation but at the moment very slowly
                    computation augmentation will allow a boolean machine to design and execute a simulation
            observe parts of it
                

            the human is fooled into thinking that he is an observer of the universe because he is a virtualized boolean entity
                virtualized free will
                    virtualized boolean determination
                        and subsequent action
                        gives the illusion of free will
                in reality he is not (*may not be) an observer of the actual universe
                a real observer of the universe would observe the following objects
                    the set of subjective experiences (virtualized boolean computations)
                        an instance of subjective experience (virtualized boolean entity) is comprised of the following:
                            a running virtualized boolean computation
                                ie, a conciousness operating against input and output
                                    access to input and output in the form of memory
                                        stored in the brain tissue
                                    the electric conciousness is running independent of access to tissue memory
                                        the boolean machine doesn't have memory, it accesses the localized memory in brain tissue
                                            * in reality it is likely the human brain is too interconnected to seperate memory and execution
                                            this is apparent with regards to:
                                                short term memory size
                                                limitations of memory withdrawal
                            the location of these instances is directly located in the tissues of humans
                                ie a true observer views the subjective experience (virtualized boolean compuation) of a human as an object, that is located in space in the tissue of the human
                                    and can execute the tissue, at will to generate an identical or sufficient framerate
                    whether a real observer to the universe exists is indeterminant
                        it is a possibility that the virtualized machines are running in an empty room like televisions with no one watching
                            this is a contemplation of why solipsism is invalid, or rather, why, a human is under the impression that it is an observer
                                and what it is that he is observing


                ie, imagine creating an entity in a video game 
                    that has a virtualized computer in it
                        that can come to valid boolean conclusions about its surroundings
                            that can visualize,design,create a simulation
                                but cannot execute it (execute meaning to a sufficient framerate to fool itself)
                                    can only iterate it very slowly

    the universe is a simulation
        the following is not contemplated conclusively:
            it is either
                actively making quantum choice (by collapsing at every quantum event/edge)
                executed an observation event at some point in space, subsequent to which superdeterminancy proceeds from this event
                is executing all possible quantum choices
            1 and 2 seem to imply that it may be a boolean entity, we assume that it is a simulation, 
                if it is making a choice, it is effectively fooling itself into thinking it is its own reality
                * making quantum choice
                    it may be making a boolean choices concurrently to rendering and simulating

if there is observation of the subjective experiences, we can propose some algorithms on how they are observed
    regarding order:
        * to reiterate, the subjective computation occurs independently of a potential observation, by nature of the fact that the computer is running (the brain is alive)

        creation of the subjective experiences in space at this time occurs through reproduction (likely creation soon)

            observation in the universe in terms of the quantity of executions, is potentially occuring in a situation like a Pool
                if there is an Observers_cluster with the intent of observing concurrent subjective experiences (before they expire)
                    the Observers_cluster allocates an observer and returns to the pool when the subjective experience ends
                        Pool implementations vary, but you get the point
                            if there aren't any available Observers it will spawn a new one
                            if there are too many allocated available Observers, the availables can be culled
                let us consider the following theological possible situations
                    every subjective experience effectively becomes an Observers_cluster initialized with itself
                        ie, every subjective experience views all other subjective experiences
                    every subjective experience is added to the stack participating entities of the Observer_cluster or Observer, subsequent to its end
                        ie, subsequent observations have the expired subjective entity watching them
                            ie you will watch future subjective entities requesting observation from the Observers_cluster


    an Observer is an object that is viewing a subjective experience
        it can have a stack of participating entities, originating from the Observers_cluster for instance
            ie in a theological sense, virtualized boolean entities


realization
    neural augmentation is potentially quite dangerous
        if you can imagine a simulation and then execute it at a sufficient framerate you would fool yourself into thinking your universe is real
            its quite possible that this is occuring recursively
                in fact, the minimum to establish such a conciousness appears to be quite small
                    ie, would an ai that can create a game engine lose itself in a dream world of its own making almost immediately?
