natural selection's discovery of conciousness
    anthropocentric view of selection of random mutations encoding conciousness to fundamental particle

theory:

    conciousness is not created by the brain
        conciousness is discovery of a phenomenon exhibited by the fundamental particle (or instantaneous/multiparticle cognizance of the universe)
            the phenomenon is described as follows:
                the brain discovered that it can encode information (namely filtered sensory information)
                    into a form that is samplable by the monad (fundamental particle)
                        or an instance in time is sampleable by monad if the brain is not encoding a fundamental particle in some fashion
                    and query this physical arrangement for useful output
                        unbeknownest to it, the fundamental particle experiences this encoding in what "you" experience as conciousness
                            the brain or your body, is not aware that conciousness is occuring nor is it creating it
                                it is encoding to the fundamental particle a sufficient and continuous dataset that the fundamental particle is without any say, returning valuable output to the brain
                                    it is likely that conciousness is operating more continiously independently of the brains structure
                                        the brain is sampling intent and output independently of the fundamental particle understanding natural selections creation
            and subsequent random development by our dna

                of a feedback loop that initiates quantum conciousness
                    that happened to be beneficial to the organism in this anthropocentric history

            mans experience and seemingly advanced state of development, is a view on an anthropocentric surviving universe
